Vimprobable
===========

A Vim-like web browser that is simple, but not too simple.

A word from the local forker
----------------------------

I decided to fork the entire project and put it on GitHub. It's primarily a dorky way to save my Vimprobable2 preferences and keep on top of the changes in the code base.

It's public, and anyone and everyone is encouraged to try it out.
